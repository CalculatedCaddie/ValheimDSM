# ValheimDSM
This is a small python program I wrote to help automate the process of Dedicated Server Management. It gets the information needed from the user then creates the necessary batch files to update and start the Valheim Dedicated Server. It removes the need to manually restart and update the server through steam on the windows platform.
This project was created under the GNU license and is free to redistribuite and modify.

Installation instructions:
Download and extract the ValheimDSM.exe file to the desired directory and run the program.
